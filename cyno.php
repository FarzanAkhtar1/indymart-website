						<h2>What is Cynos'R'Us?</h2>
						
						<p>Ever needed to move a capital ship but didn't have the time, resources or skillpoints to do so and didn't trust anyone to light them for you?
						Well this is exactly what I do, I offer cynos in certain key locations and charge a fee for lighting one.</p>
					
						<b2>I charge a <b>low fee of 15m per cycle of cyno (Regular, industrial or covert)</b> you require and attempt to work with your schedule. I am based in EUTZ thus I may not be available at all times of day, however it is in your best interest to PM me and ask. You can contact me on Brave Slack: @indybro or Discord: Fazzy#6116 <br></b2>
                        <br>
                        <b2>One thing to note with this service is that you will reimburse the cost of the ship if due to unfortunate circumstances it is destroyed whilst providing the service, this will be determined at time of booking. But as you only pay the price if the ship is destroyed it works better for you as you don't need to cough up the ISK up front.</b2>
                        <br>
                        <b2>The locations I service currently are:</b2>
                        <br>
                        <b2><b>GE-8JV ('Marginis' Fortizar)</b2>
                        <br>
                        <b2>3-UCBF (Keepstar)</b></b2>
                        <br>
                        <b2>-</b2>
                        <br>
                        <b2>Indybro's Cyno Service, which has the services of three professional drivers and two "customer care specialists," has long been described as a "sophisticated, fast, inexpensive service. It provides an efficient, effective solution for the most difficult situations. It is available to many licensed private taxi drivers."
                            And, the report suggests: "the rate of fatalities for this service was 5 per 1,000 trips. This is a considerably lower rate than other companies and the safety of the passengers is always the main concern."
                            The service is not without its critics. They say that CynUber and StarLyft are simply taking it upon themselves to become the "cyno pooling" service that has so many critics.
                            "You can't be a capital pilot in without an CynUber account," Richard Brown, a private contractor and CynUber provider, told SCC. "The problem with sharing is that it creates a culture for it where there are not checks and balances."
                            But others are calling them CynUber-lite, saying they offer a different safety experience than a traditional cyno service.</b2>
